    "The Lion, Goat, and Grass problem is a classic example of a river crossing puzzle. In this problem, a farmer needs to transport a lion, a goat, and grass across a river. The farmer has a boat that is small and can only carry one of these items along with the farmer at a time. The challenge arises from the following constraints:  \n",
    "1. If the lion and the goat are left together on the same side of the river without the farmer, the lion will eat the goat.  \n",
    "2. If the goat and the grass are left together on the same side of the river without the farmer, the goat will eat the grass.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to devise a strategy that allows the farmer to transport all three items (the lion, the goat, and the grass) across the river without any of them being eaten.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent the state with a tuple of four boolean values (farmer, lion, goat, grass), where False might represent an item being on the original side (left) and True being on the destination side (right). Not all tuples are valid."

    "The Breadth First Search Algorithm is defined using a First-In First-Out (FIFO) queue. Each item in the frontier queue stores the configuration sequence to the current problem configuration, and the final item in the configuration sequence is the current problem configuration. This allows for easy tracking of the configuration sequence to the target configuration when reached. Each item is popped off the front of the frontier queue to ensure a FIFO structure and the problem configuration is compared against the target configuration. If the problem configuration matches the target configuration, the configuration sequence to the target configuration is returned. If it is not the target configuration, the possible children configurations from this configuration are determined using the generate_possible_children_configurations function and only unvisited configurations will be explored to make the search more efficient. Unvisited children configurations are then added to the back of the frontier queue, and the frontier queue is searched until either the target configuration is found or there is no possible solution discovered."
